# R Training Prerequisites

Read and follow the instructions in the first six pages of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf). I will assume that you will come into the workshop knowing the basics of R and RStudio.

Now that you've installed R and RStudio, you'll need to install the tidyverse library. (The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data analysis). In the console, run `install.packages("tidyverse")` to download and install the tidyverse. Every time you open RStudio, you have to run `library(tidyverse)`, either in the console or a script, to be able to use these packages.

That's it! See you at the workshop.
